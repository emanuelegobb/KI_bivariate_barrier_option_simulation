# Monte Carlo Pricing of a Knock-In Call Option

This repository contains a Python implementation (via Jupyter Notebook) for pricing a **knock-in call option** using a **Monte Carlo simulation** approach. The option is based on two correlated assets with discrete monitoring, and the payoff depends on whether the barrier condition on the first asset is met.

## üìò Overview

* **Product:** European-style knock-in call option on two assets
* **Barrier Type:** Up-and-in (on the first underlying asset)
* **Pricing Method:** Monte Carlo simulation
* **Correlation:** The two assets are simulated with positive correlation

## üìà Features

* Simulates correlated geometric Brownian motions for the two assets
* Weekly monitoring of the barrier condition
* Calculation of discounted expected payoff at maturity
* Visualization of simulation paths
* 3D surface plots of option value across different volatility and correlation values
* Analysis of confidence intervals and convergence
* Comparison with a digital knock-in option
* Computation of option Greeks

## üß≤ Theoretical Background

This project simulates the pricing of a Knock-In European Call option, whose payoff depends on two securities:

* **S1** determines the activation of the barrier.
* **S2** is the underlying of the call once the barrier is touched.

Let the barrier level `b > S1(0)` be monitored at discrete dates. The barrier is activated if:

```
max{S1(t1), ..., S1(tM)} ‚â• b
```

The final payoff is:

```
X(T) = max(S2(T) - K, 0) √ó ùüô{barrier is breached}
```

This framework enables the simulation of price paths and determination of payoffs conditional on barrier activation.

### Monte Carlo Implementation

* Discrete-time SDEs for asset dynamics
* 10,000 simulations with weekly monitoring (52 steps)
* Barrier activation tracked via max price of S1 in each path
* European call payoff computed on S2 and filtered based on barrier
* Final price: discounted expected value over all valid paths

### Sensitivity Analysis

* Explored how the price responds to changes in volatility (`v1`, `v2`) and correlation (`rho`)
* Observed flattening of price sensitivity to `v1` as `rho` increases
* Found increasing sensitivity to `v2` with higher correlation

### Confidence Interval Study

* Investigated how price precision improves with:

  * More frequent monitoring (e.g., daily vs weekly)
  * Increasing number of simulations (diminishing returns above \~6000)

### Digital Option Comparison

* Compared knock-in call with a knock-in **digital** option
* Identified differences in price behavior relative to `v1` and `v2`

### Greeks Computation

* Computed **Delta**, **Gamma**, and **Vega** using central difference estimators
* Notable findings:

  * Greater Vega for `v2` than `v1`
  * Delta more sensitive to `S2` than `S1`
  * Gamma near zero, but becomes more relevant near the barrier
